## Key Features

### Intelligent Agents 
- **Task Understanding**: Breaks down complex requests into actionable steps
- **Context Awareness**: Considers your preferences and past actions
- **Adaptive Learning**: Improves workflows based on your feedback
- **Multi-Step Automation**: Handles complex sequences automatically

### Data Powers 
- **Universal Search**: Find anything across all your digital spaces
- **Smart Integration**: Connect and sync data between any services
- **Knowledge Graph**: Build connections between your information
- **Visual Processing**: Extract and understand information from images

### Privacy First
- All processing happens locally on your machine
- Your data never leaves your control
- Bring your own AI models and API keys
- Customizable data retention policies

## How It Works

alBERT uses a powerful knowledge graph to understand and connect your digital world:

- **Action Learning**: Observes and learns from your browser interactions to understand common workflows
- **Semantic Understanding**: Maps relationships between your actions, data, and applications
- **Smart Adaptation**: Builds personalized automation paths based on your usage patterns
- **Context Awareness**: Uses graph relationships to understand the full context of your requests

### Privacy-First Architecture

alBERT is designed with privacy at its core:

- **Local Knowledge Graph**: Your entire knowledge graph is stored locally using an embedded graph database
- **No Data Sharing**: Your actions, preferences, and patterns never leave your device
- **Cloud Optional**: Only AI models run in the cloud - bring your own keys for complete control
- **Offline Capable (Coming Soon)**: Core functionality works offline, cloud features are optional

The knowledge graph grows smarter over time, making alBERT increasingly better at understanding and automating your specific needs - all while keeping your data under your control.
